# Todo List App

This is a simple Todo List application created using React. It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task has a status (completed or incomplete) and a priority (low, medium, or high). The application provides basic functionality to manage tasks, including displaying tasks, marking them as completed, and deleting them.

## Features

Display a list of tasks with their respective status
Each task has options to mark as completed , delete or pdate.
Include a counter for total tasks and completed tasks.
Ability to add a new task.
Ability to edit an existing task.
Ability to mark a task as completed.
Ability to delete a task.
Styling for a clean and user-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS.
Utilization of React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) as needed.
Use of any React state management tool to manage the application's data (if needed).
Bonus: Implementation of local storage to persist tasks even if the user refreshes the page.
Special Challenge: Basic filtering system based on Priority.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
